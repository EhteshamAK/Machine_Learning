1. [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/EhteshamAK/Machine_Learning/blob/master/titanic-eda-decisontree.ipynb)
This project aims to predict passenger survial  using a decision tree classfication model. 
It explores various features such as Pclass(Passenger class),Sex, Age, SibSp(Siblings/Spouse), Parch(Parents/childrens), Ticket, Embarked to estimate passenger survival accurately.
