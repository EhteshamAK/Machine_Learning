# Machine_Learning
Welcome to the Machine Learning Project Repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that showcase various techniques, algorithms, and applications in the field of data science.

# Projects
1. [Titanic Survival Prediction](https://github.com/EhteshamAK/Machine_Learning/blob/master/titanic-eda-decisontree.ipynb): 
This project aims to predict passenger survial  using a decision tree classfication model. 
It explores various features such as Pclass(Passenger class),Sex, Age, SibSp(Siblings/Spouse), Parch(Parents/childrens), Ticket, Embarked to estimate passenger survival accurately.

# Getting Started
To get started, simply navigate to the project of interest and follow the instructions provided in the README file. You can explore the code, run the notebooks, and experiment with different techniques to deepen your understanding of machine learning algorithms and their practical applications.

# Contributions
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have a machine learning project that you would like to share or if you would like to enhance the existing projects, feel free to submit a pull request. Together, we can create a valuable resource for the machine learning community.

Happy exploring and learning!
